I creat a folder and inside the folder i creat a project with uv(uv init --package)
Then i creat a file moodmate.py.Inside the file i write my agent code where i import agent and dotenv and also os.
at the end i apply the logic of file handling to add the agent's output in output.md
After this i created a file output.md where the agent's output will will be stored
after all of these i run the command of uv add openai-agents and uv add dotenv
