Oh, I'm really sorry to hear you've been feeling anxious and low on energy. That sounds like a lot to handle. It's completely understandable to feel overwhelmed when you're experiencing those feelings.

First, let's take a moment to acknowledge that it's okay to feel this way. It's a normal part of life, and many people experience similar feelings from time to time. You're not alone in this.

When you're feeling anxious, sometimes focusing on your breath can help calm your nervous system. You could try a simple breathing exercise: Inhale deeply through your nose, hold for a moment, and then exhale slowly through your mouth. Doing this a few times can sometimes help center you.

As for the low energy, sometimes gentle movement can make a difference. Even a short walk outside or some light stretching might help to get your blood flowing and boost your mood a little.

And remember, it's essential to be kind to yourself during this time. Try to do something that you enjoy, even if it's just for a few minutes.

What activities usually bring you comfort or joy, even if it's hard to imagine them right now?
